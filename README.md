### Chatbot: 
A chatbot is software that simulates human-like conversations with users via text messages on chat.

A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone.
Why are chatbots important? A chatbot is often described as one of the most advanced and promising expressions of interaction between humans and machines. However, from a technological point of view, a chatbot only represents the natural evolution of a Question Answering system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). Formulating responses to questions in natural language is one of the most typical Examples of Natural Language Processing applied in various enterprises‚Äô end-use applications.

### SUMMARY:

We are using Machine Learning techniques and especially Natural Language toolkit

**PROCESS :**
1. Import necessary libraries
2. Downloading and installing NLTK
3. Converstation of test as in upper case adnd lower case
4. Removing unneccessarry noise
5. Keyword similarizartion
6. Generating Response

### NLP:

NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.
